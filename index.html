 		Hi, my name is Anouck Thaler, I'm 18 years old, born on the 1st April of 2006 and I am in my first year in business school. I am a person that is jovial, curious, altruistic and really faithful. Sports and music have been part of my education, there are things that are really important for me. I love discovering new things, like countries or activities.

		I have been practicing piano for 10 years, it is a passion for me, I love playing it because it is a time where I can be in my bubble, where I am happy. I also love playing with my friends because everyone can sing over and that is really incredible.

	<h2>Singing</h2>
	<p>
		It helps Other than piano, I sing thanks to my mother whom is part of a band. Singing is really unique, where we feel sensations, thrills and mostly when it's a song of a really talented person like Amy Whinehouse, Queen...
